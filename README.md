# Github Configuration

This repository containts the configuration for my Github account. Using Terraform I provision new repositories and manage my SSH and GPG public keys.

## Why?

- Create new repositories easily, with default settings
- Provision repositories with secrets that are stored in Azure Key Vault
- Manage my account's SSH and GPG public keys
